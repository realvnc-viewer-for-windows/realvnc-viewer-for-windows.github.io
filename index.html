        <h2>Overview — What is RealVNC Viewer?</h2>
        <p>
          RealVNC Viewer (also called VNC Viewer) is the client application used to remotely view and control computers running a compatible VNC server (for example, RealVNC® Server). VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a cross-platform screen sharing and remote control protocol that transmits the remote display and relays keyboard and mouse events.
        </p>

        <p>
          RealVNC connects to devices either directly over the network (direct mode) or via the RealVNC cloud service (RealVNC Connect cloud relay). This combination of direct and cloud-assisted connectivity provides flexibility: direct connections are faster and keep traffic on your LAN, while cloud connections simplify NAT traversal and remote access across the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          While VNC technology has existed for decades, RealVNC's implementation focuses on security, cross-platform compatibility, and production features such as encryption, access control, and centralized management for teams.
        </p>

        <h3>Who should use RealVNC Viewer for Windows?</h3>
        <ul class="nice-list">
          <li>System administrators and IT help desks who need remote access for support and maintenance.</li>
          <li>Professionals accessing their work computer from home or on the road.</li>
          <li>Home users who need remote access to a family PC or media server.</li>
          <li>Organizations that require secure remote control and auditing features across multiple devices.</li>

    <!-- INSTALLATION -->
    <section id="install" class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How to Install RealVNC Viewer for Windows — Step-by-step</h2>

        <p>
          There are two common installation models depending on your goal: (A) installing the RealVNC Viewer client on a Windows machine so you can connect to other computers, and (B) installing RealVNC Server on the target computer if you want to be able to connect to it remotely. Below is a focused walkthrough to install the Viewer on Windows.
        </p>

        <h3>Method: Install Viewer on Windows</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
          <li><strong>Download the official installer.</strong> Visit the RealVNC official downloads page and choose the Windows Viewer installer (32-bit or 64-bit as appropriate). You can also use the APK link for mobile clients — the APK path is provided on this page for convenience.</li>
          <li><strong>Run the installer.</strong> Launch the downloaded installer and accept the UAC prompt. Follow the installer wizard. Choose standard installation unless you need custom folder locations or advanced options.</li>
          <li><strong>Launch VNC Viewer.</strong> After installation, open VNC Viewer from Start menu or desktop shortcut.</li>
          <li><strong>Create a RealVNC account (optional).</strong> For RealVNC Connect cloud services, create and sign in with a RealVNC account to see devices connected to your account and enable cloud connectivity.</li>
          <li><strong>Add a connection.</strong> Click \"File → New connection\". Enter the remote host address (IP or hostname) or the cloud device ID. Save a friendly name for the connection.</li>
          <li><strong>Authenticate and connect.</strong> Enter the authentication credentials (system password or RealVNC authentication depending on your server configuration) and accept server identity prompts if first-time connecting.</li>
          <li><strong>Tune performance and preferences.</strong> Adjust options like compression, color levels, and input behavior for the best experience under your network conditions.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Install RealVNC Server on the remote machine (if needed)</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to access a Windows computer remotely, install RealVNC Server on that machine (the remote host). Register that device to your RealVNC Connect account or configure authentication and firewall rules for direct access. Installing the Server is a separate process — the RealVNC website provides installers and configuration guidance for Windows Server and desktop editions.
        </p>

        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> RealVNC Viewer can connect to many third-party VNC servers too, but for best features and encrypted connections, use RealVNC Server when possible. See official downloads for the latest installers and checksums.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- HOW TO USE -->
    <section id="usage" class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How to Use RealVNC Viewer: Practical Workflows</h2>

        <h3>Connecting to a local machine (LAN)</h3>
        <p>
          For local network connections use the IP address or hostname of the remote computer. Make sure the remote computer's firewall permits the selected VNC port (usually TCP 5900 by default) and that the VNC Server is running.
        </p>

        <ol class="steps">
          <li>Open VNC Viewer and create a connection using the remote host's IP.</li>
          <li>Choose authentication: system credentials or VNC-specific credentials depending on server config.</li>
          <li>Accept the server fingerprint the first time — verify it via a secure channel if possible.</li>
          <li>Use the toolbar while connected to toggle clipboard sharing, scaling, and send Ctrl+Alt+Del if needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Connecting remotely over the internet</h3>
        <p>
          For remote access across the internet, either:
        </p>
        <ul class="nice-list">
          <li>Use RealVNC Connect (cloud relay) and sign in with your RealVNC account, or</li>
          <li>Open firewall/NAT rules on your router to forward the VNC port to the target machine (less recommended due to security risks).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Cloud relay is simpler and avoids NAT and port-forwarding headaches — but check your organizational policies and security posture before using cloud services.
        </p>

        <h3>Host management & multi-device workflows</h3>
        <p>
          Save a collection of connections and credentials in VNC Viewer and group them into folders for easy access. For teams, use RealVNC Connect to centrally manage device lists, permissions and access logs.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECURITY -->
    <section id="security" class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Security Best Practices</h2>

        <p>
          Secure deployment of remote access tools is essential. RealVNC provides encryption and authentication options; however operator behavior and network hardening are just as important.
        </p>

        <ul class="nice-list">
          <li><strong>Use RealVNC Connect with cloud relay and centralized auth</strong> for teams so credentials are centrally managed and auditing is available.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable strong authentication</strong> — avoid weak passwords. Use system credentials or integrate with an SSO where supported.</li>
          <li><strong>Use encryption</strong> — ensure your VNC connections are encrypted (RealVNC supports TLS encryption when configured correctly).</li>
          <li><strong>Apply least privilege</strong> — provide only the required access and limit who can access devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep software updated</strong> — apply patches on both Viewer and Server to protect from vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Network controls</strong> — restrict access by IP where possible and use VPNs for remote access rather than exposing ports directly to the internet.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor and log</strong> — enable session logging and review logs for suspicious activity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For regulated environments, use RealVNC enterprise features (role-based access, session recording, MFA integration) and follow your compliance rules.

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Troubleshooting Common Problems</h2>

        <h3>Cannot Connect / Connection Timed Out</h3>
        <ul class="nice-list">
          <li>Check remote host is powered on and running VNC Server.</li>
          <li>Verify network connectivity (ping the host IP).</li>
          <li>Confirm firewall/antivirus is not blocking VNC port (default 5900).</li>
          <li>If using cloud relay, ensure both Viewer and Server are signed in and visible in the RealVNC account device list.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Authentication Failed</h3>
        <ul class="nice-list">
          <li>Verify username/password are correct.</li>
          <li>Check whether the server expects system credentials or a VNC-specific password.</li>
          <li>Confirm account or license status for RealVNC Connect if using that method.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Poor Performance</h3>
        <ul class="nice-list">
          <li>Reduce color depth or enable adaptive compression in Viewer options.</li>
          <li>Switch to a lower bandwidth mode or limit frame rate.</li>
          <li>Check network latency; a wired connection often helps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clipboard or File Transfer not working</h3>
        <ul class="nice-list">
          <li>Ensure clipboard sharing is enabled in both Viewer and Server options.</li>
          <li>Check file transfer settings and supported features — some servers or licenses may restrict file transfer.</li>
